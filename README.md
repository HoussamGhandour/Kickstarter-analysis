Section 5 - **Recommendations** 

## 1. Overview of Project
This project performs an analysis on Kickstarter crowdfunding data to uncover trends based on launch date (months) and aimed goal (dollars).
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide Louise with a data-driven analysis that may help her with her decision making for when to launch her campaign and in her selection of an appropriate goal.
## 2. Analysis Methodology and Challenges
The analysis was performed using Excel (version 16.0.13127.20266). The analysis was completed using kickstarter data that was provided in the "kickstarter" tab in the excel sheet. Some of the used tools/functions included: filtering data, "countifs" function, creation of pivot table, creation of pivot chart, formatting and editing charts and tables for readability.

### 2.1 Challenges
There were no siginificant challenges performing this analysis. Below is a list of some of the challenges and how they were overcomed.

1) Removing the filter buttons from the Pivot Charts - Resolved by a quick Google Search
2) Adding Images to this readme file in Github - Resolved by a quick Google Search 
3) Providing data-driven recommendations based on the limited analysis that was performed - Provided Recommendation for additional analysis in the Recommendations Section

### 2.1 Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The line chart below shows that theater projects have the largest number of successful projects (111 projects) when the launch date was May. It should also be noted that the largest number of failed projects (52 projects) was when the launch date was May. More importantly, the gap which is the difference between the successful and failed projects, is largest when the lauch date was in May (111-52=59). It is recommended to use percentage of successful and failed projects instead of raw numbers to have a clearer indication of the chance of success.

### 2.2 Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The line chart below shows an alternating pattern between successful and failed play projects based on the goal ranges. It should be noted that success rate is significantly higher than failed rate for projects with a goal of 5000$ or less. Also, the goal range between 35,000 and 40,000 showed relatively high chance of success compared to the rest of ranges. The alternating pattern makes it hard to identify possible explanation. It is recommended to perform additional analysis to calculate and visualize the pledged percentage of the goal for these ranges as it might highlight better trends.
